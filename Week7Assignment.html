        <h3>A little about myself.</h3>
           <p>I immigrated from Mexico when i was 3 years old. Grew up and currently live in Arizona. <br> Went to Westwood Highschool and joined the JROTC program. I met my wife there and <br> started dating my final year there.
            We have been together for 8 years and she is still my best <br> friend. I competed with our drill team in JROTC winning competitions around Arizona. After <br> Highschool I was unsure what to do as a career. I worked 
            a few different jobs trying to figure <br> what I enjoyed. For the past 5 years I have been with The Home Depot working as a customer  <br> service representative over phone for online orders then moving to their online chat team and <br> currently 
            still doing that. I finally decided I want a career in tech after years of conteplating <br> 
            what to do. </p>
